# A fair File-sharing platform

This is a group project that was further refined and debugged by myself. In short, a cloud Trusted Document Storage was developed that was based on the Coffey and Saidha protocol 'NON-REPUDIATION WITH MANDATORY PROOF OF RECEIPT'; an inline non-repudiation protocol. Also, there are many web services that were used from Amazon which now they are inactive to avoid expenses. Detailed project explanation can be found @ Report.pdf.

## Amazon Web Services

A brief description for the selected AWS that were used:

1. Simple Queue Service (SQS): for communication purposes between entities.
2. Relation Database service (RDS): for persistent data storage.
3. Key Management Service (KMS): for signing and verifying documents.
4. Simple Storage Service (S3): for documents storage.
5. Elastic Compute Cloud  (EC2): for an online website.
